## What column(s) do the customers table and the JanSales table have in common?
  The customers table and the JanSales table both have the OrderID column in common.


##Cleaning the Data
Some OrderIDs were longer than the standard six characters or were filled in with "OrderID". Below is a chunk of 
code I wrote to be added on to the end of a clause to filter these out.


WHERE length(order_id) = 6
AND order_id <> 'Order ID'


#How many orders were placed in January? Remember to filter out the blank and incorrect order IDs.
  SELECT count(OrderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    WHERE length(OrderID) = 6
    
    
#How many of those orders were for an iPhone?    
    SELECT count(OrderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
     WHERE length(OrderID) = 6 AND Product = "iPhone"
     
#Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
  
  SELECT distinct acctnum FROM BIT_DB.Customers cust
     INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
      ON cust.order_Id = Feb.OrderID
          WHERE Orderid <> 'Order ID'
          
          
#Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
 
 SELECT product, min(price) FROM JanSales
    WHERE OrderID <> "Order ID"
    
#What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 
(Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).

SELECT product, sum(quantity * price) AS revenue FROM JanSales
WHERE OrderID <> "Order ID"
GROUP BY product

#Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT sum(quantity), product, sum(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location ='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product


###How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, 
and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT
COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum), 
AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
